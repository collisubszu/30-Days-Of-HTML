# Boy's Club by Matt Furie: A Stoner Classic for the Tumblr Generation
 
Boy's Club is a comic book series by Matt Furie, a cartoonist from Columbus, Ohio. The series follows the antics of four slacker roommates: Andy, Brett, Landwolf, and Pepe the Frog. The comics are filled with laconic psychedelia, childlike enchantment, drug-fueled hedonism, and impish mischief. The characters' insouciant attitude belies the sharp verbal and visual wit of Furie, who delivers a stoner classic for the Tumblr generation.

The series was first published online on MySpace in 2006, and later collected in a paperback edition by Fantagraphics Books in 2016. The comics have gained a cult following among fans of stoner comedies and black humor. They have also inspired countless memes and remixes on the internet, especially Pepe the Frog, who became an overnight sensation when he was adopted by users of 4chan and other online platforms. Pepe's iconic expression of "feels good man" has been used in various contexts, from pop stars like Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry to political movements like the alt-right and Hong Kong protests.
 
However, Furie's original intention for Pepe was to create a gentle and innocent character who represents the universal feeling of joy. He was dismayed by how his creation was co-opted by hateful and extremist groups, and he has tried to reclaim Pepe's positive image through legal actions and artistic projects. He is also the subject of a documentary film called Feels Good Man, which chronicles his journey of dealing with Pepe's popularity and controversy.

Boy's Club is not only a comic book series, but also a cultural phenomenon. The comics have influenced many artists and creators who share Furie's sense of humor and style. For example, Simon Hanselmann, a Tasmanian cartoonist, has created a series called Megahex, which features a group of dysfunctional and depressed characters who live together and abuse drugs. Megahex has been compared to Boy's Club in terms of its dark comedy and psychedelic aesthetics. Furie and Hanselmann have also collaborated on a comic called Seeds and Stems, which is a crossover between their respective universes.
 
Another example of Boy's Club's impact is the emergence of the "rare Pepe" phenomenon. This is a subculture of Pepe collectors who create and trade digital artworks featuring Pepe in various forms and situations. These artworks are often based on popular culture references, such as movies, video games, celebrities, and memes. Some of these artworks are also sold as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique and verifiable digital assets that use blockchain technology. The rare Pepe phenomenon has been seen as a way of celebrating Pepe's original spirit and reclaiming his identity from negative associations.
 
Boy's Club by Matt Furie is a comic book series that has transcended its medium and genre. It has spawned a legion of fans and followers who appreciate its humor and creativity. It has also faced challenges and controversies that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of online culture. Boy's Club is a testament to Furie's vision and talent, as well as to Pepe's enduring appeal and relevance.
