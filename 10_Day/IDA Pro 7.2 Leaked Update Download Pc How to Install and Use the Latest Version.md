In 2019, Hex-Rays released IDA Pro 7.2, which introduced many new features and improvements, such as enhanced support for PIC microcontrollers, NEC 850 processors, and ARM64 decompiler.
 
However, some users claimed that they found a leaked version of IDA Pro 7.2 on the internet, which they could download and use for free. They posted links to websites that allegedly hosted the cracked software, such as [^2^].
 
However, downloading and using such software is illegal and risky. It may violate the intellectual property rights of Hex-Rays, expose the user to malware infections, or damage the user's system. Moreover, it may not work properly or have all the features of the official version.
 
Therefore, it is strongly advised to avoid downloading or using any leaked or cracked version of IDA Pro 7.2. Instead, users should purchase a legitimate license from Hex-Rays or use the free version of IDA Pro 5.0 that is available on their website.
