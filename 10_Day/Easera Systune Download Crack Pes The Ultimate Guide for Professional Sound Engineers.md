# EASERA and SysTune: Powerful Tools for Acoustic and Electronic Measurements
 
EASERA and SysTune are two software products developed by AFMG (Ahnert Feistel Media Group) that offer professional solutions for acoustic and electronic measurements. Both software can be used with any built-in or external soundcard and support various types of measurement signals, such as sweeps, MLS, noise or TDS. In this article, we will compare and contrast the features and applications of EASERA and SysTune, and explain how they can be used together with PES (Professional Electroacoustic System).

## EASERA: Electronic and Acoustic System Evaluation and Response Analysis
 
EASERA is a software for acoustic and electronic analysis with industry standard quality and incredible flexibility and power. It consists of four logical parts: signal generator, measurement, real time analyser and post processing. EASERA can perform data acquisition with a variety of stimulus signals, including Time Delay Spectrometry (TDS), sweeps, MLS or noise excitation signals, and calculate all acoustic functions or measures according to ISO Standard 3382 and higher. The real time analyser provides multiple ways to perform a fast onsite analysis or to obtain a precise view of the surrounding acoustic environment. EASERA can also import and export data in various file formats, such as WAV, MLSSA, EASE or TEF. EASERA is suitable for room-acoustic and electro-acoustic evaluation of halls and venues, as well as for research and development purposes.
 
## SysTune: Live Sound Measurements in Real Time
 
SysTune is a software for live sound measurements in real time. It is based on AFMG's patented RTD algorithm, which enables measuring and processing full-length impulse responses in real time. The impulse response contains all data describing the system's and the room's acoustical behavior, so a full-length impulse response is essential for reliable measurements providing valid data. SysTune offers a large set of unique features to make a technician's life easy and speed up the work, such as:
 
- Virtual EQ to simulate effects of tuning without the need for ongoing measurements or influencing the live signal
- Unique Delay Analysis module for fast and precise optimization of loudspeaker delay times
- Universal Web Interface for remote control of measurements from smartphones and tablets
- Integration with DSPs, controllers and other hardware like Lake Controllers and many others
- Unmatched noise immunity thanks to the patented SSA filter
- Numerous further functions for better windowing and higher bass resolution

SysTune is the proven real-time audio analysis software by AFMG. It was developed especially for live sound applications and has been setting the standard for professional real-time measurement and display of impulse responses, transfer functions and other data. SysTune can also perform multiple simultaneous measurements on up to eight channels with sampling rates from 8 kHz to 192 kHz.
 
## PES: Professional Electroacoustic System
 
PES is a hardware device that integrates with EASERA and SysTune to provide a complete solution for acoustic and electronic measurements. PES is a high-performance audio interface that offers:

- Four balanced analog inputs with phantom power
- Four balanced analog outputs with adjustable level
- Two digital AES/EBU inputs/outputs
- USB 2.0 connection to PC
- 24-bit/192 kHz resolution
- Built-in DSP for signal processing
- Support for EASERA's TDS module
- Support for SysTune's DSP plug-ins

PES can be used as a standalone device or as part of a networked system with multiple PES units. PES allows users to perform high-quality measurements with EASERA or SysTune without the need for additional hardware or software.
