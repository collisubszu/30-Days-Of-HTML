If you are wondering how to use After Effects Projects Big Pack No 3, here are some tips and tricks to help you get started. First, you need to download and unzip the pack. You will find a folder with the project files and a folder with the video tutorials. The video tutorials will show you how to use each project and how to customize it. You can also refer to the PDF file that contains the links and instructions for each project.
 
Next, you need to open After Effects and import the project file that you want to use. You can do this by going to File > Import > File and selecting the project file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the project file into the Project panel. Once you import the project file, you will see a composition with the name of the project. Double-click on the composition to open it in the Timeline panel.
 
Now you can replace the placeholders with your own media and text. To do this, you need to find the layer that contains the placeholder in the Timeline panel. You can identify it by its name or by its icon. For example, if you want to replace an image placeholder, look for a layer with a camera icon and a name like "Image 1". To replace it, simply drag and drop your own image into the Project panel and then drag it onto the placeholder layer in the Timeline panel. You can also right-click on the placeholder layer and choose Replace Footage > File and select your image file.
 
To replace a text placeholder, look for a layer with a T icon and a name like "Text 1". To edit it, simply double-click on it and type your own text. You can also change the font, size, color and other properties of the text in the Character panel or the Effect Controls panel.
 
After you replace all the placeholders, you can preview your video by pressing the spacebar or by clicking on the Preview button in the Preview panel. You can also adjust the duration, speed, transitions and other settings of your video in the Composition Settings or in the Effect Controls panel.
 
When you are happy with your video, you can render it by going to Composition > Add to Render Queue. In the Render Queue panel, you can choose your output format, quality and destination. Then click on Render and wait for your video to be exported.
 
Congratulations! You have just created a stunning video using After Effects Projects Big Pack No 3. You can now share it with your audience or use it for your own purposes.
