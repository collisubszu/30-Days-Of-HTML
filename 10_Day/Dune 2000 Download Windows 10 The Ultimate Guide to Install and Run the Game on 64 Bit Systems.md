## Dune 2000 Gameplay Tips
 
Now that you have installed Dune 2000 on your Windows 10 or 11 PC, you might want some tips to improve your gameplay and strategy. Here are some useful tips to help you conquer Arrakis:

- Harvest spice as much as possible. Spice is the main resource in Dune 2000 and you will need it to build units and structures. Spice fields are marked by orange patches on the map. You can use harvesters to collect spice and carry it back to your refinery.
- Protect your harvesters. Harvesters are vulnerable to enemy attacks and sandworms. You can use escort units to guard them or build repair pads to heal them. You can also deploy concrete slabs around your refinery to prevent sandworms from emerging.
- Build a balanced army. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Atreides units are fast and accurate, but have low armor. Harkonnen units are powerful and durable, but slow and expensive. Ordos units are stealthy and agile, but weak and unreliable. You should build a variety of units to counter different threats.
- Use special weapons wisely. Each faction has access to a special weapon that can turn the tide of battle. Atreides can call an airstrike that damages a large area. Harkonnen can launch a devastating nuclear missile. Ordos can unleash a saboteur that can destroy buildings instantly. However, these weapons have a long cooldown time and cost a lot of spice, so use them sparingly.
- Explore the map and capture buildings. The map of Dune 2000 is full of secrets and surprises. You can find hidden spice fields, crates with bonuses, neutral buildings with benefits, and enemy bases with weaknesses. You can use scouts, engineers, or infiltrators to explore the map and capture buildings.
