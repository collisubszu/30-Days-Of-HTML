The price of the standard is $69.00 and the price of the films is $285.00 as of April 2023.
 
So, how can you download ASTM E155 PDF for free? There are some unofficial sources that claim to offer free downloads of ASTM E155 PDF, but they may not be reliable or legal. Some of them may contain viruses, malware, or outdated versions of the standard. Some of them may also violate the copyright or license agreement of ASTM International.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend downloading ASTM E155 PDF from any unauthorized websites or sources. Instead, we suggest that you either buy the standard and the films from ASTM International or use their online viewing service. The online viewing service allows you to access the standard and its reference radiographs on your computer or mobile device for a limited time period. You can also print or save a copy of the standard for your personal use.
 
To use the online viewing service, you need to create an account on the ASTM Compass website and pay a fee of $15.00 per standard per day. You can then view the standard and its reference radiographs on your screen or download them as PDF files. You can also search, zoom, annotate, and compare different versions of the standard.
 
The online viewing service is a convenient and affordable way to access ASTM E155 PDF without violating any rules or regulations. It also ensures that you get the most accurate and up-to-date information on inspection of aluminum and magnesium castings.

ASTM E155 provides reference radiographs that show the types and degrees of discontinuities that may be found in castings of different thicknesses. Discontinuities are defects or imperfections that may affect the quality, performance, or safety of the castings. Some examples of discontinuities are gas porosity, shrinkage, cracks, inclusions, and foreign material.
 
The reference radiographs are divided into two sets: one for aluminum-alloy castings and one for magnesium-alloy castings. Each set contains 13 categories of discontinuities, each with three levels of severity: A (least severe), B (moderately severe), and C (most severe). The reference radiographs are intended to be used as a basis for comparison with actual radiographs of castings.
 
The purpose of ASTM E155 is to provide a uniform and consistent method for evaluating the quality of aluminum and magnesium castings. It also helps to establish acceptance criteria and specifications for different applications and requirements. ASTM E155 is not intended to define the limits of acceptability or rejection of any casting, but rather to provide guidance for interpretation and communication.
  
## How to Use ASTM E155 Reference Radiographs?
 
To use ASTM E155 reference radiographs effectively, you need to follow some basic steps:
 
1. Obtain the standard and the reference radiograph films from ASTM International or use their online viewing service.
2. Select the appropriate set of reference radiographs for the type and thickness of the casting you want to inspect.
3. Perform radiographic examination of the casting using suitable equipment and techniques.
4. Compare the actual radiographs of the casting with the reference radiographs and identify any discontinuities present.
5. Determine the category and severity level of each discontinuity according to the reference radiographs.
6. Compare the results with the acceptance criteria or specifications for the intended use of the casting.
7. Document and report your findings and conclusions.

It is important to note that ASTM E155 reference radiographs are not a substitute for proper training and experience in radiographic interpretation. You should also be aware of the limitations and variations that may affect the accuracy and reliability of the comparison. For example, factors such as film quality, exposure conditions, viewing conditions, image enhancement, and human judgment may influence the outcome. Therefore, you should always use good judgment and common sense when applying ASTM E155 reference radiographs.
