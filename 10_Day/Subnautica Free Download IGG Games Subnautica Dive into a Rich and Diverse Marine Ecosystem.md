## What is Subnautica?
 
Subnautica is an open world survival action-adventure video game developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. In it, players are free to explore the ocean on an alien planet, known as planet 4546B, after their spaceship, the Aurora, crashes on the planet's surface[^3^].
 
The game features a day and night cycle, a dynamic weather system, and a variety of biomes and creatures. The game also has a story mode that unfolds as the player discovers clues and secrets about the planet and their own identity. The game is praised for its immersive atmosphere, beautiful graphics, and creative gameplay.
 
## How to Play Subnautica
 
Subnautica is a game that requires players to manage their oxygen, health, hunger, thirst, and temperature while exploring and crafting. The game has four difficulty modes: Survival, Freedom, Hardcore, and Creative. Survival mode is the default mode where players have to deal with all the survival aspects. Freedom mode is similar to Survival mode but without hunger and thirst. Hardcore mode is like Survival mode but with permadeath. Creative mode allows players to build anything they want without any limitations or threats.
 
To play Subnautica, players need to collect resources from the ocean floor, such as metal scraps, quartz, salt, fish, etc. They can use these resources to craft tools, equipment, vehicles, and bases using a device called the Fabricator. They can also scan various objects and creatures using a Scanner to unlock new blueprints and learn more about them.
 
Players can explore different biomes and regions of the planet, such as the Safe Shallows, the Kelp Forest, the Grassy Plateaus, the Mushroom Forest, the Lost River, the Lava Zone, etc. Each biome has its own unique flora and fauna, some of which are friendly and some of which are hostile. Players can encounter various leviathans, such as the Reaper Leviathan, the Ghost Leviathan, and the Sea Dragon Leviathan, which are among the most dangerous creatures in the game.
 
## Tips and Tricks for Subnautica
 
Subnautica can be challenging for some players to adapt to. Here are some tips and tricks that can help beginners and veterans alike:

- Scan everything. Scanning is one of the most important actions in the game. It allows you to unlock new blueprints, learn more about the environment and the creatures, and advance the story[^1^]. You can scan almost anything in the game using your Scanner tool.
- Read your PDA to advance the story. Your PDA is your personal digital assistant that records everything you do and see in the game. It also receives radio messages from other survivors or alien sources that can give you clues or objectives. Reading your PDA can help you understand what's going on and what you need to do next[^1^].
- You swim faster with nothing equipped. If you need to escape from a predator or reach the surface quickly, you can swim faster if you unequip any tool or item from your hands. This can save you precious seconds of oxygen or health[^1^].
- Food and water don't tick down if you're sitting in a chair. If you need to take a break or wait for something to happen in the game, you can sit in a chair in your base or vehicle. This will pause your hunger and thirst meters until you get up[^1^].
- Pass the time in a bed. If you don't like exploring at night or want to skip a stormy weather, you can sleep in a bed in your base or vehicle. This will fast-forward time until morning or until the weather clears up[^1^].
- You can throw things away in trash cans. If you have unwanted items that are taking up space in your inventory or storage lockers, you can dispose of them in trash cans. This will delete them from the game permanently[^1^].
- Don't cook fish until you need them. If you catch fish for food, don't cook them right away unless you're going to eat them immediately. Cooked fish will spoil over time and lose their nutritional value. Instead, keep them alive in your inventory or storage until you're ready to cook 8cf37b1e13
