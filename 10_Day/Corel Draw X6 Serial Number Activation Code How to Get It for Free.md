## How to Use CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6
 
CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6 is a powerful and versatile software that allows you to create stunning graphics, logos, illustrations, layouts, web designs, and more. Here are some tips on how to use it:

- Explore the workspace. CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6 has a user-friendly and customizable interface that lets you access the tools and features you need. You can choose from different workspaces, such as Default, Lite, Adobe Illustrator, or Adobe Photoshop, depending on your preference and experience level. You can also customize the workspace by docking, undocking, resizing, and rearranging the toolbars, menus, and panels.
- Use the CorelDRAW toolbox. The toolbox contains the main tools for creating and editing graphics. You can select a tool by clicking on its icon or pressing its keyboard shortcut. Some tools have flyouts that show additional tools or options. You can access them by clicking on the small arrow in the lower-right corner of the tool icon. You can also right-click on a tool to switch to its alternate tool.
- Work with objects. Objects are the basic elements of your graphics, such as shapes, lines, text, bitmaps, and symbols. You can create objects using the drawing tools or by importing them from other sources. You can select objects using the Pick tool or the Shape tool. You can modify objects using the transformation tools, such as Move, Rotate, Scale, Skew, and Mirror. You can also apply effects and attributes to objects using the interactive tools, such as Blend, Contour, Drop Shadow, Envelope, Extrude, and Transparency.
- Work with layers. Layers are like transparent sheets that you can stack on top of each other to organize your objects. You can create and manage layers using the Object Manager docker. You can name, lock, hide, show, reorder, group, and merge layers. You can also change the properties of layers, such as color, outline width, and printability.
- Work with colors. Colors are essential for creating attractive and realistic graphics. You can choose colors from different color models and palettes using the Color Palette docker or the Color Picker dialog box. You can also create custom colors using the Color Editor docker or the Color Harmonies docker. You can apply colors to objects using the Fill tool or the Outline tool. You can also use the Eyedropper tool to pick colors from other objects or images.
- Work with text. Text is another important element of your graphics. You can create text using the Text tool or by importing it from other sources. You can edit text using the Text docker or the Property Bar. You can format text using the Character Formatting docker or the Paragraph Formatting docker. You can also apply effects and attributes to text using the interactive tools or the Object Properties docker.
- Work with bitmaps. Bitmaps are images composed of pixels that have a fixed resolution and size. You can create bitmaps using the Bitmaps menu or by importing them from other sources. You can edit bitmaps using the Image Adjustment Lab docker or the Corel PHOTO-PAINT application. You can also apply effects and filters to bitmaps using the Effects menu or the Corel PHOTO-PAINT application.
- Work with symbols. Symbols are reusable objects that you can store in a library and use multiple times in your graphics. You can create symbols using the Symbol Manager docker or by converting existing objects into symbols. You can edit symbols using the Symbol Editor docker or by double-clicking on them in your graphics. You can also apply effects and attributes to symbols using the interactive tools or the Object Properties docker.
- Save and export your graphics. When you finish your graphics, you can save them in different formats using the File menu or the Save As dialog box. You can choose from a variety of formats depending on your purpose and destination of your graphics. Some of the most common formats are CDR (CorelDRAW), AI (Adobe Illustrator), EPS (Encapsulated PostScript), PDF (Portable Document Format), JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), PNG (Portable Network Graphics), GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). You can also export your graphics for web use using the Web Image Optimizer docker or for printing use using the Print Preview dialog box.
