## Poetry
 
Poetry is one of the oldest and most popular genres in Tamil literature. Tamil poetry is known for its rich imagery, musical language, and emotional expression. Tamil poetry can be broadly classified into two categories: Sangam poetry and post-Sangam poetry.
 
### Sangam poetry
 
Sangam poetry is the poetry that was composed during the Sangam period (300 BCE-300 CE), which is considered the golden age of Tamil literature. The Sangam period was named after the Sangam academies, where poets and scholars gathered to produce and share their works. Sangam poetry comprises eight anthologies ( Ettuthokai ) and ten long poems ( Pattuppattu ), which deal with various aspects of life, such as love, war, nature, and ethics. Sangam poetry is characterized by its realism, naturalism, and humanism. Some of the famous Sangam poets are Kapilar, Paranar, Avvaiyar, and Thiruvalluvar.
 
### Post-Sangam poetry
 
Post-Sangam poetry is the poetry that was composed after the Sangam period, from the 4th to the 9th century CE. Post-Sangam poetry includes religious and devotional poetry, satire and humor, and narrative poetry. Post-Sangam poetry is characterized by its use of symbolism, allegory, and fantasy. Some of the famous post-Sangam poets are Manikkavacakar, Andal, Thirumoolar, and Kamban.
 
## Fiction
 
Fiction is another important genre in Tamil literature. Tamil fiction includes novels, short stories, and novellas. The first Tamil novel was published in 1893 by P. R. Krishnamurti, titled *Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram*. Since then, Tamil fiction has undergone significant developments, with many writers making significant contributions to the genre. Tamil fiction covers a wide range of themes, such as social issues, political themes, romance, adventure, and historical fiction.
 
### Novels
 
Novels are long prose narratives that depict fictional characters and events. Novels are usually divided into chapters and have a plot structure that includes exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.
