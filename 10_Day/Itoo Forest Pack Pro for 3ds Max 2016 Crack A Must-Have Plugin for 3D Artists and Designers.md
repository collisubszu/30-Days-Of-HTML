## Step 2: Create a surface
 
Before you can scatter objects with Forest Pack Pro, you need to create a surface to distribute them on. This can be any geometry object in your scene, such as a plane, a terrain, or a spline. You can also use multiple surfaces for different areas of your scene. For example, you can use a plane for the ground, a terrain for the hills, and a spline for the road.

## Step 3: Create a Forest object
 
Once you have a surface ready, you can create a Forest object by going to Create > Geometry > iToo Software > Forest Pack Pro. A Forest object is a special helper that controls the scattering parameters and displays the scattered objects in the viewport and render. You can create multiple Forest objects for different types of objects or layers.
 
When you create a Forest object, you need to assign a surface to it by clicking on the Surface button and picking an object from your scene. You can also use the Areas rollout to add or remove areas using splines or objects. By default, the Forest object will scatter some grass blades on your surface. You can change this by adding or removing items from the Geometry List.
 
## Step 4: Add items to the Geometry List
 
The Geometry List is where you define what objects you want to scatter with Forest Pack Pro. You can add any geometry object from your scene or use one of the presets from the iToo Software libraries. The libraries include high-quality models of trees, plants, rocks, buildings, crowds, and more. You can access them by clicking on the Library Browser button.
 
To add an item to the Geometry List, you can drag and drop it from your scene or from the Library Browser. You can also use the Add button and pick an object from your scene. You can add multiple items to create variations and diversity in your scatter. Each item has its own properties that you can adjust in the Modify panel, such as scale, rotation, density, probability, tint, animation, etc.
 
## Step 5: Adjust the distribution parameters
 
After adding items to the Geometry List, you can adjust how they are distributed on your surface using the Distribution rollout. Here you can choose between different distribution modes, such as Point-Cloud, Grid, Path, Reference, or Paint Areas. Each mode has its own settings that you can tweak to achieve different results.
 
You can also use maps to control the distribution of your items based on texture or vertex colors. For example, you can use a noise map to create random clumps of grass or a gradient map to create transitions between different types of plants. You can also use maps to control other parameters such as scale, rotation, density, probability, tint, etc.
 
## Step 6: Render your scene
 
Once you are happy with your scatter settings, you can render your scene using any renderer that supports iToo Forest Pack Pro for 3ds Max 2016. The plugin uses native shaders and proxies to render scenes with virtually unlimited numbers of objects and polygons without putting a strain on computer resources. You can also use effects such as motion blur or depth of field to enhance your renders.
